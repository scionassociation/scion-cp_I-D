      "body": "This issues lists all unaddressed feedback from reviews of the Control Plane draft before January 2024. New feedback is in dedicated issues\n\n(Aggregated from https://github.com/scionassociation/standards/issues/79 and https://github.com/scionassociation/standards/issues/90)\n\n\n**General points:**\n- [x] #7 \n- [x] Add Security Considerations (see also [RFC 3552](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3552.html)) \n- [x] Make sure the references are correct: \n       - #14 \n       - #15 \n       - Normative references: Needed for the specification; specification is based on it.\n       - Informative references: Provide background/additional information\n-  #12 \n- [x] What text can be removed? Be concise. Make sure every word that is there must be there. \n- [x] ~~If time allows, add related work (not too academical, just overview)~~\n- [x] Complete IPR disclosure process with Anapaya. See also: https://github.com/scionassociation/standards/issues/101\n- [x] #8\n- [x] Improve the definition of \"endpoint\"\n- [x] section 2.1: \"Intra-ISD beaconing creates path segments from core ASes to non-\ncore ASes.\" sounds a bit vague. We could rephrase with something like this text, that Matthias wrote for the documentation: \"Every core AS originates PCBs at regular intervals, and sends these to all egress interfaces to connected neighbor ASes. An originated PCB sent to a neighboring core ASes initiates an inter-ISD beacon, ultimately resulting in a core-segment. An originated PCB sent to a child AS initiates the intra-ISD beacon creating an up/down segment.\"\n\n**ISE Feedback:**\n- [x]  #17 \n- [x] #21\n- [x] **Remind reader about critical terminology** , as we introduce quite a lot of new acronyms.  For some critical ones, we should remind reader what they mean along the document, so reader is reminded. THis especially for: \n\u201cISD\u201d should be defined on first use.\nSame goes for PCB \n- [x] #18\n- [x] ~~**Interoperability**: we should add something especially for data and CP. There could even be one separate document for the ISE on the topic.~~ --> TO be handled in separate future documents\n- [x] ~~**Deployment**: add what is needed to run SCION, we can leave a reference to scion.org, scion Association~~ --> We are working on a separate draft for PANRG\n- [x] #19\n- [x] #20\n- [x] **Get some third party review**: do I have enough information to build SCION from the draft? Ask someone who is building SCION to check if the drafts are enough to build a SCION implementation.. Do they spot inconsistencies?  Example: they are building a Bluetooth ALG, and the coders realized that there are some small divergencies..\n\n**Decision TC Standardisation**\n- [x]  #9\n\n**Eliot Lear (ISE IETF):**\n- [x] Section 1.3 would benefit from a one or more simple diagrams that demonstrates an ISD, ASes, and the various types of links.  Please keep the diagrams small.  **--> CdK: Added one relatively small figure of an ISD with all link types to section 1.3.**\n- [x] I would like you to spend a bit more time on loop detection.  In particular, I would like you to explain how loops are averted within richly connected cores. **--> CdK: Added some additional text about avoiding loops to section 2.3.2.1.**\n- [x] Along those same lines, classic routing geeks will look for two words in this draft and not find them: partition and healing. Partition occurs when one network is split into two because of a link failure.  Healing is the process of recovery from partition.\n- [x] I find Section 1.5.2.1 confusing.  You seem to be saying that for values greater than 232-1, you should represent them in colon-separated lower-case hex, but then you go on to say, \u201cprograms SHOULD always use the decimal representation for display.\u201d  I would say: pick a way you want things displayed and stick to it. **--> CdK: Adapted the sentence about this in section 1.5.2.1 \"Formatting\" to make it more clear.**\n- [x] In Section 1.6, please create normative references for both GRPC and protobufs. **--> CdK: Done**\n- [x] I hope this doesn't come as a shock to you, but Figure 2 in Section 2.1.4 is quite busy, and requires a more detail, flow-based explanation.  Please give that some thought. **--> CdK: Done**\n- [x] The text below Figure 2 and above Figure 3 could be simplified to say that a PCB consists of one or more path segments at a given time T from the vantage point of a particular AS F.  Also, I think there's an editorial error in that diagram, unless I'm confused.  You label two segments \"path segment 2\" (the 2nd and the last).  I am further confused by the terminology, given the diagram, in that the diagram seems to infer a link-state database. **--> CdK: Done**\n- [x] I think for 2.2.1, it helps to show a full example message, or otherwise link to one in the Appendix. **--> CdK: Added an Appendix with a full example of one PCB in Protobuf message format.**  \n- [x] Section 2.2.1.4.3 is underspecified.  It must be crystal clear how to sign a message and how to verify it.  Now I think your intent is to have a separate document for that.  If so, leave a forward reference for now. **--> CdK: Added a mathematical formula and a reference to the relevant section in the SCION CP-PKI Internet-Draft.**\n\n**Juan Garcia-Pardo:**\n- [x] Can one ingress or egress be part of two different links? Refers to section 1.3 \"Introduction > Paths and Links\". --> we clarified over time that IF IDs MUST be unique, therefore they cannot be part of more than one ingress/egress\n- [x] Explain why there is a \"next_isd_as\" field in the signed component of an AS body element (PCB). Refers to section 2.4.2 \"PCB > AS Entry Signed Component\". #97 \n- [x] Where do the suggested values for set size and propagation time of PCBs in section 2.3.1.1. \"Storing and Selecting Candidate PCBs\" come from? Do they depend on the network topology? Explain. --> This relates to scalability concerns, handled in #8 \n\n**Roger Lapuh:**\n- [x] Add an overview picture to section 2.2.1 \"Paths and Links\". \n- [x] Networking is very sensitive to flooding. So reading this as network engineer causes some concerns. In order to remove concerns the flooding terminology should always be supported with a statement along which path flooding is used and how flooding loops are prevented. _CdK: I have replaced the term \"flooded\" with \"sent\"._\n- [ ] ~Explain why why 4030 ISDs is enough for public addressing. Refers to section 2.2.3 \"Addressing > ISD Numbers\"\nSee~ https://github.com/scionassociation/scion-deployment_I-D/issues/1 \n- [x] #22\n",

On the one hand, SCION claims to scale well (presumably to large numbers of participating AS.  There is no discussion of the effect of the number of participants or meshiness on the number of PCBs.  There are very strict limits on the rate at which PCBs are propagated.  But no analysis as to whether the system will ever converge .  Particularly if the number of interfaces between AS becomes large. \r\n\r\nSomething about convergence time and scalability should be added to the draft. We could start from something like this:\r\n> Note that, since there is no convergence phase in SCION, we cannot compare to BGP\u2019s convergence time.

See also Eliot Lear's mail from 28.8:\r\n\r\n> There is an issue in Section 1.5.2:\r\n> There will be a conflict if the IETF decides to increase the ASN size.  This may not make it past the IESG in RFC 5742 review.  I just went through this with GNS and would not like to repeat that experience.  Therefore, my suggestion is that you view the ASN field as two separate fields: BASE and and EXTENSION, where if EXTENSION is 0, base must be an IANA-assigned ASN value.\r\n> \r\n\r\nAt the 3rd TC meeting on Tuesday 5 September, it was decided that the SCION AS numbering will not be described in detail in the CP draft. It should be mentioned that the SCION AS numbering is totally independent from the BGP AS numbering.

          "body": "- [x] What selection policy do we have implemented now @jiceatscion ?\n- [ ] Shall we add a more formal representation of policies? Or at least we should add some more specific wording about them:\n\n___ \nFeedback from David Galan:\n\n4. Regarding PCB Selection Policies (now mentioned in Section 2.3.1.1 \"Storing and Selecting Candidate PCBs\" and in Subsection 2.3.1.2 \"Selection Policy Example\"), we think it is important to introduce a more structured representation for those policies.\n\nAs part of our formal analysis, we have been using a particular representation of these policies that might be a good fit for this I-D. A possible way to explain our representation in English prose is as follows: \n\n\"A PCB Selection Policy can be expressed as a stateful filter of paths, i.e., a function which indicates whether to accept or deny a given path. This filter is stateful in that it can be updated each time its AS registers a new segment (e.g., for policies based on path diversity).\"\n\nAs future work, we believe that it would be particularly beneficial to the community if we extend this definition to include a machine readable (i.e., source code) representation for policies. This would, for example, enable the use of tools to compare different policies.\n\n\n5. In Subsection 2.2.4. \"Configuration\", consider mentioning that the PCB Selection Policy chosen by the AS should be such that it does not accidentally isolate the AS from the network, i.e., such that it does not block upstream connectivity to providers and ensures downstream connectivity for customers.\n\n6. Our formal model reveals that certain degenerate PCB Selection Policies may potentially undermine some properties. While the proposal outlined in point 5 (question B) addresses the majority of these concerns, it is nevertheless advantageous to incorporate a more precise methodology for delineating reasonable and unreasonable policies.\n\nTo this end, we propose the inclusion of one or more reference PCB Selection Policies. These reference policies impose minimal requirements on the ASes\u2019 own policies, but ASes are otherwise at liberty to make their own selection decisions. A (sub)network of ASes following these requirements is guaranteed to enjoy the Control Plane\u2019s correctness and security properties and, in particular, connectivity between any pair of ASes in that subnetwork. \n\nWe have designed an algorithm to compare PCB Selection Policies. This algorithm can be used to decide whether an AS policy adheres to a given reference policy.\n\n\nAlso relates to #72 ",

It can perfectly be unique to each implementation of the SCION stack and even each deployment. For that reason, a protocol specification has no business impeding that freedom.\n\nIndeed, I already mention to David that I'd not add a specific machine-readable representation for policies.. So I think we can look at improving the text we have, but without adding a specific representation.",

This is\n789      described in Section 2.3.3.\n```\n>  What is the criteria used to determine the \"best\"?  \u00a72.3.3 lists some\nfactors, and \u00a72.3.4 recommends the size of the PCB set.  However, it looks\nlike the selection of the \"best\" is not deterministic; instead, it is\nlocally determined based on policy -- is that correct?\nThere is then a possibility of \"conflicting\" policies.  I'm thinking\nespecially of the core where (in a triangle configuration, for example) two\nISDs may prefer each other to reach the third one...  Is this possible?\nLook at rfc7789; it is the best example I can think of right now.  I\nunderstand the differences, but the effect of filtering prefixes (rfc7789)\nmay be similar to \"filtering\" PCBs using policy.\n\n\n```\n[] \"SHOULD adopt a PCB selection policy...does not accidentally isolate the AS from the network\"\n```\n\nWhen is it ok to adopt a policy that isolates the AS from the network? ;-)   The use of \"SHOULD\" implies that there are cases where it is ok not to do what is specified.  In this case, I assume it is never ok to select a policy that isolates the AS -- and if it were done, then it wouldn't be accidental.\n\nThis is to say that this sentence has no Normative value here.

This means that each AS can use a different MAC algorithm, while interoperating with other ASes.

I am expecting to need to interoperate with solutions from other vendors.  I have no problem with allowing a range of choices.  But I need something that ensures interoperability.  The usual answer is to say that all implementations must implement and support X, and that operators can use anything they like that their devices support as long as all devices in the AS use the same thing. </jmh>\r\n\r\nRight, this depends on the MAC algorithm. Safely truncating requires certain MAC algorithms, e.g. ones that have properties of a pseudorandom function.

The term \"propagation interval\" might not be entirely apropos for beacon origination, but the concepts are identical.

If anything, we'd want to separately configure a frequency for core and non-core beaconing, but the configuration does allow to make this distinction. \r\nIn the draft, I think this also not necessary.

That doesn't mean that it won't take some time to actually build the paths from that point on, just that nothing special needs to be done.\r\nIt's a bit vague, and perhaps also not very illuminating, but to me it seems that this doesn't _have to_ discuss the time until paths are found.",

The two topics (circular dependencies and partitioning) appear unrelated. Partitioning is discussed in a separate subsection\r\n- Also, this section claims to contain a list that explains how circular dependencies are avoided.\r\n  However, I am not sure how anything in the list explains anything about circular dependencies?\r\n\r\n### Partition and Healing\r\n- `ASes could always switch to otherwise unused links`. \r\n\r\n  - What are `unused` links? `Unused` indicates that they are not in the \"Best PCB\" set. \r\n  If that is the case, then we cannot simply \"switch\" to use them, we first need to have them discovered by beacons. This takes time, see `propagation interval` (unless PCB are forwarded immediately) and beacon `origination interval`.\r\n  - Also: Does \"Healing\" include \"adding new links\"? In this case we also need to wait for the `propagation interval` and the `origination interval`.\r\n  As I understand, with propagation interval being set to e.g. 10Minutes, this adds up to 5hops*1/2*10min= 25minutes for 5 hops.\r\n\r\n# Path Exploration or Beaconing {#beaconing}\r\n## Introduction and Overview\r\n\r\n- `Intra-ISD beaconing`: Isn't this incomplete?

          "body": "> Is it feasible to have 150 thousand signature validations per second as we mention in the draft?\n\nI did some experiments on this a while ago, as during one of our projects the signature verifications were found to be a bottleneck on the hardware we used, and therefore had to be disabled. I still have some microbenchmarks from the signature verification in scionproto,  that might help inform the draft: \nVerifying a single AS entry (on Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 7 155H) takes about 65 microseconds. Considering an average PCB length of 6, that would mean verifying a PCB takes 390 microseconds, which is roughly 2564 PCB verifications per second per core. \n\nTo continue with the example in the draft, an AS receiving 1.5 million PCBs per 60s propagation interval, would thus need at least 10 dedicated cores for the signature verifications.  \n\nNote that this is assuming all AS certs are already at the local AS, if these need to be fetched first, the throughput would obviously be lower.  It should be taken into account that a control service will have other tasks, and will have to create the signatures too, requiring more compute than the 10 cores.\n\nI do believe there is still some gain in optimizing the current implementation in scionproto, so these numbers could certainly improve. More lightweight cryptographic schemes could help too, there are some recent advancements with efficient and lightweight post-quantum (or IoT) signatures. Distributing it over multiple control services, as proposed in the draft, seems to be the easiest solution.\n\nSmall sidenote, the draft assumes 5 path segments to every destination AS are discovered, in the current scionproto the default limit is set to 20 PCBs for each destination that are selected for propagation: https://github.com/scionproto/scion/blob/1615ae80e004f1753028a9990abd9928c8aa332d/control/beacon/policy.go#L104",

      "body": "> Feedback Harald Alvestrand\r\n> The description of SCION refers to using UDP/IP as the internal substrate inside an AS, and as a framing protocol on inter-AS links. This means that the Internet MTU of 1500 bytes (1200 for IPv6) will be in effect.\r\nPath hops take 12 bytes + a couple of \u201csegment headers\u201d of 16 bytes - which means that a 10-hop, 3-segment path will take 168 bytes for the routing information. This is enough to reduce the MTU significantly, and the MTU will be unpredictable and maybe variable, since the path for a given packet may change dynamically.\r\n(The packet format, like UDP\u2019s, permits 68K-byte packets. However, fragmentation is A Thing.)\r\n\r\nAlso, I find this text is not clear: \r\n```\r\n mtu: The size of the maximum transmission unit (MTU) within the\r\n      current AS's network.\r\n```\r\nShoudln't this be the minimum MTU among alll intra-domain links in the AS (so the maximum supported MTU for intra-domain forwarding)? Maybe we can find a better wording\r\n\r\nRelated issues: \r\n* DP draft: https://github.com/scionassociation/scion-dp_I-D/issues/39\r\n* Implementations: https://github.com/scionproto/scion/issues/2608 ",

My only reference is the scion daemon which makes exactly these assumptions:\r\n\r\n> Paths represent a sequence of ASes and inter-AS links; each with possibly different MTUs. As a result, a path has an effective MTU which is the least of the MTUs of each link and ASes it traverses. The relevant MTUs for calculating a path's effective MTU are available from the segments used in its construction:\r\n> \r\n> - The MTU of the first and last ASes (represented by the mtu field of the corresponding AS Entries)\r\n> - The MTU of each inter-AS link or peering link (indicated by the ingress_mtu field of each hop or the peer_mtu field of each Peer Entry used)\r\n> - The MTU of any intra-AS network traversed if the ingress and egress interfaces of a hop exist on two different border routers\r\n> \r\n> Regarding the later point: A scion host using a path segment has no means of knowing whether a given hop implies traversing the corresponding AS' internal network or not, and the control service does not reduce the hop's MTU when that is the case. As a result, a scion host building a path must assume that all hops are constrained by the AS's internal network MTU.\r\n>\r\n> This could be optimized if the control service was required to make the hop's ingress_mtu field no greater than the MTU of the AS in case of a hop crossing the internal network. However existing implementations have not historically done this.\r\n\r\nIn section 2.2.1.4.2 AS Entry Signed Body, describe the mtu field as follows:\r\n\r\n> The maximum transmission unit (MTU) that is supported by all hosts within the AS being described. This is set by the control service adding the entry to the beacon. How the control service obtains this information is implementation dependent. Current practice is do make it a configuration item.\r\n\r\nIn section 2.2.1.5 Hop Entry, describe the ingress_mtu field as follows:\r\n\r\n> Specifies the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the ingress interface (in beaconing direction) of the hop being described. Packets traveling through the associated inter-AS link in either direction cannot exceed this size (not including the L2 header). As a result, no path segment constructed from the containing beacon can have an MTU greater than this. How the control service obtains the MTU of an inter-AS link is implementation depend. It may be discovered or configured. Current practice to make it a configuration item.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn section 2.2.1.7 Peer Entry, describe the peer_mtu field as follows:\r\n> Specifies the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the peering link being described. Packets traveling through this link in either direction cannot exceed this size (not including the L2 header).

My point is that rfc2119 talks about using Normative language when the action is important for interoperability.  In this case, because the nodes can do anything (\"implementation dependent\"), there's not really an option.  If there was an option, it would be between configuring and what?

Diversity is a comparative metric: beacon A has a diversity score over beacon B (and that's not commutative). The score is the number of links in A that don't appear in B. Our diversity choice is the beacon not among the shortest that is the most diverse (so, basically most different) from the very shortest one.

The current phrasing may be incorrectly interpreted to mean that traffic flowing normally from parents to children also forms a valley.\n- [x] From \"All path segments may be inverted\" ([\u00a71.4.1 para. 4](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-dekater-scion-controlplane-06.html#section-1.4.1-4)) onwards, replace occurrences of \"inverted\" with \"reversed\" consistently.\n\n## Organizational Suggestion:\n- [x] Move the explanation \u201cA range of AS numbers can be shortened with a notation similar to the one used for CIDR IP ranges ([RFC4632])\" ([\u00a71.5.4.2 para. 4](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-dekater-scion-controlplane-06.html#section-1.5.4.2-2.3.1)) so that it appears before [Table 2](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-dekater-scion-controlplane-06.html#table-2), where this notation is used.\n\n- [x] Furthermore, as detailed in question B, we identify a need for more comprehensive discussion security and correctness properties of the Control Plane. While the current introduction briefly mentions security aspects and mentions valley freedom, we suggest that it also mentions the properties proposed in this review. --> Add a reference to a new security properties section after #89  is solved",

We propose that assumptions about the network and the behaviour of honest ASes are made more explicit. We would be happy to help with a specific list of assumptions:\n\n- In our formal model, we assume that the network of physical links is such that no ISD is internally partitioned (i.e., each AS in an ISD can reach every other AS in the same ISD), --> See #46 \n- every ISD has at least one core AS, and\n- customer-provider relationships (and related links) form a unidirectional hierarchical topology without cyclic relationships (i.e., they form a directed acyclic graph).\n\nAn AS is called honest if its long-term keys are unknown to the attacker and it uses a unique interface identifier for each link. Let an honest path (resp., segment) be a path (resp., segment) which only traverses honest ASes.\n\nEven though this is explicitly stated elsewhere in the draft, perhaps Subsection 2.2.4. \"Configuration\u201d should also mention that interface identifiers must be unique within an AS.\n\n\n2.   Regarding correctness and security properties, we suggest inserting a new Subsection 6.1 \"Correctness and Security Properties\" in Section 6 \"Security Considerations\" containing precise descriptions in English prose that faithfully capture all the required details and avoid ambiguities.\n\nWe would be happy to contribute a list of candidate properties and their descriptions. These properties should be understood as carefully considered design goals.  Within our formal model, the properties considered so far are:\n- (Connectivity) For every pair of distinct honest ASes X and Y, such that there is at least one honest path in the network of physical links from X to Y, X will eventually register enough segments to build at least one path (of any length) leading to Y.\n- (Path Consistency) For every honest segment registered in any AS, its sequence of AS entries corresponds to a continuous path in the network of physical links. This property holds only if the network topology remains unchanged since the segment was first generated.\n- (Loop Freedom) For every honest segment registered in any AS, its sequence of AS entries (including current and next ISD-AS, as well as interfaces) contains no duplicates.\n- (Beacon Authorization) For every honest segment registered in any AS and any AS X appearing on that segment - - (except for the last one), AS X propagated a PCB corresponding to the segment prefix ending in its own entry to its successor AS on the segment.\n- (Path Discoverability) For every directed honest path in the network of physical links, where all traversed ASes permit forwarding, there exists at least one protocol execution that registers a segment containing or exactly matching this path. This property holds only when the involved physical links remain stable throughout the protocol execution.\n\nWe can offer formal expressions of the properties in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), which is part of the IEEE 1850 Standard for Property Specification Language (PSL), as well as other formal artifacts such as a labeled transition system that describes the protocol behaviors. This may be a good fit for future work (e.g. in UFMRG).",

We propose that the local checks performed by each AS, necessary to ensure protocol correctness, are clarified. Currently, the draft requires that honest ASes validate the signatures in PCBs. However, honest ASes may accept malformed PCBs, even after a successful signature validation, unless they also perform some additional local checks. These local checks occur mainly in two key moments of the protocol:\n\n- (Reception) Subsection 2.3.2.1 \"Reception of PCBs\" details the local checks performed when an AS received a beacon propagated by another AS. We have synthesized a minimal set of additional checks that are required for protocol correctness, and we propose their inclusion in the I-D:\n\n    - (Cores) During core beaconing, the receiver Control Service must check every AS entry and discard PCBs that were propagated at any point (according to the `signed.header_and_body.body.isd_as' field) by a non-core AS.\n    - (Interfaces) If the received PCB was (a) last propagated by AS X (according to the `signed.header_and_body.body.isd_as' field of the last AS entry), and (b) was received through the local AS interface i (according to local knowledge of the Control Service), then the local knowledge of the receiver Control Service MUST agree that the link behind interface i indeed leads to AS X.\n    - (Continuity) When a PCB contains two or more AS entries, the receiver Control Service must check every AS entry except the last and discard beacons where the field `signed.header_and_body.body.next_isd_as' of an entry does not equal the field `signed.header_and_body.body.isd_as' of the next entry\n\n- (Remote registration) In subsection 4.1 \"Intra-ISD Path Segment Registration\" consider mentioning that, during remote registration (a phase of intra-ISD beaconing) of a PCB from an AS X into the database of an AS Y, AS Y must not accept the PCB if an AS other than Y generated it (field `signed.header_and_body.body.isd_as' of the first AS entry).",

It might not be so easy: yes, a collection of accurately implemented and honest ASes will automatically prevent a non-core AS from beaconing a core segment.

Yes, that is what happens, but at the protocol level, SCION doesn't care. So it is the choice of the control service implementation to do that. The problem is that, as implemented, the CS expects the client to do that. I don't think it is actually able to process anything but resolution messages when receiving a QUIC/SCION connection packet. So, we'd have to describe the entire CS rpc protocol in excruciating details in order to be complete.\n",

ISD Numbers\n```\n542   An ISD number is the 16-bit global identifier for an ISD and MUST be\n543   globally unique.\n\n545   The following table gives an overview of the ISD number allocation:\n\n547     +==============+================================================+\n548     | ISD          | Description                                    |\n549     +==============+================================================+\n550     | 0            | The wildcard ISD.                              |\n551     +--------------+------------------------------------------------+\n552     | 1 - 15       | Reserved for documentation and sample code     |\n553     |              | (analogous to [RFC5398]).                      |\n554     +--------------+------------------------------------------------+\n555     | 16 - 63      | Private use (analogous to [RFC6996]).  Can be  |\n556     |              | used for testing and private deployments       |\n557     +--------------+------------------------------------------------+\n558     | 64 - 4094    | Public ISDs.  Should be allocated in ascending |\n559     |              | order, without gaps and \"vanity\" numbers.      |\n560     +--------------+------------------------------------------------+\n561     | 4095 - 65535 | Reserved for future use.                       |\n562     +--------------+------------------------------------------------+\n\n564                      Table 1: ISD number allocations\n\n566   Currently, ISD numbers are allocated by Anapaya, a provider of SCION-\n567   based networking software and solutions (see [ISD-AS-assignments]).\n```\n\n>  Suggestion: the Anapaya site doesn't have a summary similar to Table 1.\nIf anyone is looking there, they won't know which ISD can be used for\ntesting (for example).  You might want to include this information, similar\nto the IANA pages. ;-)\n\n\n### 1.5.2.  SCION AS Numbers\n```\n571   A SCION AS number is the 48-bit identifier for an AS.  Although they\n572   play a similar role, there is no relationship between SCION AS\n573   numbers and BGP ASNs as defined by [RFC4893].  For historical reasons\n574   some SCION Autonomous Systems use a SCION AS number where the first\n575   16 bits are 0 and the remaining 32 bits are identical to their BGP\n576   ASN, but there is no technical requirement for this.\n```\n> [] s/RFC4893/RFC4271 I know that there isn't a specific definition in rfc4271 of an ASN (there\nisn't one in rfc4893 either).\n\n###  1.5.3.2.  AS numbers\n```\n587   The text representation of SCION AS numbers is similar to IPv6 (see\n588   [RFC5952]) but not identical.  It MUST be as follows:\n\n590   *  It uses a 16-bit colon-separated lower-case hex encoding with\n591      leading 0s omitted: 0:0:0 to ffff:ffff:ffff.\n\n593   *  The :: zero-compression feature of IPv6 MUST NOT be used.  The\n594      feature has very limited use in a 48-bit address space and would\n595      only add more complexity.\n\n597   *  A range of AS numbers can be shortened with a notation similar to\n598      the one used for CIDR IP ranges ([RFC4632]).  For example, the\n599      range of the lowest 32-bit AS numbers (0-4294967295) can be\n600      represented as 0:0:0/16.\n\n602   *  For historical reasons, SCION AS numbers in the lower 32-bit range\n603      MAY also be represented as decimal for human readability.  For\n604      example, if a program receives the AS number 0:1:f, it MAY display\n605      the number as \"65551\".\n```\n> IMHO, the comparison to RFC5952 makes the explanation more complex as\nyou have to then explain the exceptions (::)...\n\n### Example\n```\n614   For example, the text representation of AS number 65551 (0x1000f) in\n615   ISD number 4 is 4-0000:1:f.\n```\n\n> 0000:1:f doesn't follow the rules in \u00a71.5.3.2: the leading 0s are\nincluded.  Shouldn't it be 1:f?\n\n### Table 2: AS number allocations\n\n> Maybe this table belongs in \u00a71.5.2.\n",

So, 65551 will be printed out as 65551. Both `0000:1:f` and `0:1:f` will be parsed (and `0:1:f` seems to be a more common option according to the tests), and `1:f` is not correct since the implementation expects that there will be three parts in the address.",

I would prefer that the decimal representation be non-canonical, but it might be too late to change it because of existing certs and cert verification/generation code.\n* Possibly indicate where the non-canonical form is allowed, if anywhere. At least mention the PKI draft and the certificates as a place where only the canonical form is allowed.\n* Clarify that the leading zeros suppression still must leave one 0; this isn't self evident.\n* Make sure that we use the canonical representation everywhere in the drafts that calls for a canonical representation.\n* Specify in the PKI draft where the definition of \"Canonical representation\" is and remove it for the PKI draft itself.\n",

The certificate MUST have a validity period fully containing\n1368\t   that of the segment being verified, regardless of current time.  The\n1369\t   signature Sig_i of an AS entry ASE_i is computed over the AS entry's\n1370\t   signed component.\n```\n\n[] \"The certificate MUST have a validity period fully containing that of the segment being verified...\"\n\nI can read this a couple of different ways...but neither seems fully specified!\n\n1- What is the validity time of the segment?  Is that the Expiration Time in the Hop Field?  Which one?  If so, then it should be specified that if the certificate's validity period is less than the Expiration Time, the PCB MUST be discarded (?).\n\n2- If we're not talking about the Expiration Time, the PCB MUST become invalid when the certificate's validity period ends.\n\n\n```\n...\n1620\t2.2.3.  PCB Validity\n...\n1630\t   For the purpose of validation, a timestamp is considered \"future\" if\n1631\t   it is later than the current time at the point of validation plus an\n1632\t   allowance for differences between the validator's and originator's\n1633\t   clock.  As an allowance, it is recommended to use the granularity of\n1634\t   the hopfield expiration time (that is 337.5 seconds, see\n1635\t   Section 2.2.1.6).\n\n1637\t   For the purpose of validation, a hop is considered expired if its\n1638\t   absolute expiration time, calculated as defined in Section 2.2.1.6,\n1639\t   is later than the current time at the point of validation.\n```\n> [] Should the same allowance be made in this case?\n\n@jiceatscion how is this allowance counted for hops? We now point to section 2.2.1.6 which says: \n```\n   *  exp_time: The 8-bit encoded expiration time of the Hop Field,\n      indicating its validity.  This field expresses a duration in\n      seconds according to the formula: duration = (1 + exp_time) *\n      (24*60*60/256).  The minimum duration is therefore 337.5 s.  This\n      duration is relative to the PCB creation timestamp set in the\n      PCB's segment information component (see also Section 2.2.1.2).\n      Therefore, the absolute expiration time of the Hop Field is the\n      sum of these two values.\n```\n\nI assume that the 1 in the formula represents the allowance, do you confirm that?

The +1 is simply so we don't waste bits encoding the useless value zero. As we say, the minimum value that can be expressed is one time the quantum; not zero. I guess it is worth saying. The confusion comes from the name of the duration \"exp_time\" which suggests that it expresses an absolute time. I guess we need to say that too. Because of this I guess the reader felt justified to conflate the allowance (applied after computing the absolute time), with the plus 1 (applied to exp_time).\n",

          "body": "Regarding 2.3.5.1. I am honestly a bit confused about the cases when we use inter- and intra- in the different places of the draft. The draft says `Inter-ISD or core beaconing is the process of constructing path segments between core ASes in the same or in different ISDs` and `Intra-ISD beaconing creates path segments from core ASes to non-core ASes` in 2.1. But in 1.4, it says `SCION inter-domain routing operates on two levels: within a ISD which is called intra-ISD routing, and between ISD which is called inter-ISD routing`. So, when we speak about routing, everything that happens inside an ISD is intra-ISD routing. But with beaconing, the beaconing between two core ASes in the same ISD is inter-ISD beaconing. If I had to choose, I wouldn't use intra- and intra- in the case of beaconing. We have a term for core beaconing and don't have the term for another kind of beaconing though.\n\nOther than that, I agree that `to propagate to its neighboring child ASes` is cleaner. I don't think that \"neighboring\" is needed though: looks like in the other places of this draft we already say \"its child ASes\" implying that it's just a child and not a \"grandchild\" or any other descendant",

Security Properties\n\n3129\t   The SCION control plane provides various security properties, as\n3130\t   discussed below.  Here, an AS is described as 'honest' if its private\n3131\t   keys are unknown to the attacker and if it uses a unique interface\n3132\t   identifier for each link.  An honest path is one that only traverses\n3133\t   honest ASes.  A honest segment is the one created by an honest AS.\n\n[] As characterized, an honest AS can still provide false information; for example, including a false Key ID, incorrect interface IDs, etc.  In the case of incorrect interface IDs, the PCBs may look ok and pass the consistency and connectivity tests, but forwarding may fail.\n\n@dgalan7 this text comes as a result of your feedback. Did you model what would happen if an AS sends incorrect data in a beacon (e.g. interface IDs)? We might need to extend the definition of honest ASes\n\n\n```\n...\n3160\t   To ensure that the properties hold across the overall SCION network,\n3161\t   all core ASes should be able to reach each other with some sequence\n3162\t   of core links, and all non-core ASes should have at least one path up\n3163\t   to a core AS.  Furthermore, to ensure that the properties hold within\n3164\t   a single ISD, all cores ASes of the ISD should be able to reach each\n3165\t   other without leaving the ISD, i.e., for every pair of cores in an\n3166\t   ISD there is a sequence of SCION links that only traverses ISD\n3167\t   members.  A core AS may reach other core ASes in the same ISD via\n3168\t   other ISDs.  This may be permitted, depending on the ISD's policies.\n```\n\n>> [] Should the conditions in this paragraph be described using Normative language?\n\n> I\u2019m thorn on this.

          "body": "> Did you model what would happen if an AS sends incorrect data in a beacon (e.g. interface IDs)?\n\n(TL;DR: In our current model, an AS that accidentally includes incorrect information is considered dishonest. Thus, some properties about beacons handled by such an AS may no longer be guaranteed to hold; the beacon is only *partially* valid.)\n\nIn our model, a beacon is tentatively considered *valid* when it meets six key criteria:\n\n- Non-empty: there is at least one (signed) hop entry.\n- Rooted: the first hop entry has the corresponding fields set to null, indicating that the beacon started there rather than being a suffix of a larger path.\n- Continuous: each hop's `next` field matches the subsequent hop's `current` field.\n- Acyclic: no duplicated hop entries (still under discussion).\n- Network-consistent (*): hop entries correspond to actual network topology links.\n- Valley-free (*): follows standard valley-free routing principles.\n\nHonest ASes perform sanity checks on received beacons and drop invalid ones. However, local validation has inherent limitations. While ASes can easily verify some properties (like non-rooted beacons), they cannot fully validate network-wide consistency or valley-free properties across the entire path. Thus, beacons traversing only honest ASes should remain fully valid, as the aggregation of all local checks appears sufficient to ensure end-to-end validity, while those passing through paths containing mixed honest/dishonest ASes may only be *partially* valid. The properties marked with (*) above are those that may be lost in paths that involve dishonest ASes.\n\nFor incorrect interface IDs specifically, each AS is only required to know its own interfaces, so validation is limited to local checks. ASes only verify that the beacon's claimed source matches the known remote end of their receiving interface. In other words, this covers the last hop entry only. Previous hops in the path are not verified, allowing dishonest ASes to potentially include incorrect interface information without detection. So \"network-consistency\" (of interfaces) is one of the aspects of validity that may be lost in mixed honest/dishonest paths.\n\nGoing back to your question, an \"honest\" AS is currently defined as one that follows all specification requirements (\"MUST\" clauses) and performs operations correctly. This includes ASes that accidentally include incorrect information: they are still considered dishonest/non-compliant under this working model. The terms \"compliant\" or \"correct\" may be more precise than \"honest.\" This approach aligns with distributed algorithms literature, where Byzantine fault models treat accidental errors and malicious behavior equivalently as \"arbitrary failures\", since both can cause nodes to deviate from correct protocol behavior and require the same defensive mechanisms.\n\n> In this case I was thinking more s/should/MUST. The conditions should still be valid regardless of the size of the SCION network: if isolated from others then the conditions apply only to what is deployed.\n\n(TL;DR: We suggest flexible \"if you want these properties for the considered subnetwork, then follow these prerequisites\" phrasing instead of strict requirements, allowing non-standard SCION deployments while making trade-offs clear.)\n\nOur approach aims to frame network topology assumptions to be evaluable universally across any subnetwork. For any given subnetwork, if it meets the specified assumptions and contains sufficient honest (compliant) ASes, then the security properties should hold within that subnetwork. This generalized framing would eliminate the need for specific language like \"for properties to hold for an ISD...\" in favor of universal statements applicable to any network scope.\n\nHowever, not all assumptions may be practical for every real-world deployment. Some network operators might prefer more flexible topologies even if it means sacrificing certain formal guarantees. Therefore, rather than using strict \"MUST\" requirements, it may be better to frame the specification as conditional: \"if you wish to have these properties, then these are the prerequisites to follow\". This approach would avoid unnecessarily constraining valid SCION deployments while clearly communicating the trade-offs.\n\nThe long-term goal is to establish more precise mappings between specific assumptions and their corresponding properties. This would enable network operators to understand exactly which guarantees they retain, which require manual verification, and which become impossible when they deviate from particular topology requirements. Such granular mapping would provide operators with informed choices about their deployment trade-offs rather than an all-or-nothing approach to compliance.",

The descriptions don't seem to\ninclude anything (beyond the PathSegmentUnsignedExtensions) that could also\nbe signed.\n\n#### Some thoughts:\n\nThe figure in [2.2.1.4.3.  AS Entry Signature](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-dekater-scion-controlplane-08.html#sign) is IMHO not right. It does not match with the definition that we give of associated data _\"data that is covered by the signature, but is not included in the header and body\"_. It contains the text below, which comes from a [comment in the segment definition](https://github.com/scionproto/scion/blob/379c6c7db20695a53b758190cd6c4302d0c3ab20/proto/control_plane/v1/seg.proto#L108). Associated data seems to be used in the same way [here](https://github.com/scionproto/scion/blob/771c63e390f81bcaf7c10c828f40e191c49af1af/pkg/scrypto/signed/msg.go#L144) in the code.\n```\ninput(ps, i) = signed.header_and_body || associated_data(ps, i)\n\nassociated_data(ps, i) = ps.segment_info ||\n                         ps.as_entries[1].signed.header_and_body ||\n                         ps.as_entries[1].signed.signature ||\n                         ...\n                         ps.as_entries[i-1].signed.header_and_body ||\n                         ps.as_entries[i-1].signed.signature\n```\n\nThe problems I see with this are:\n\n- [x] Should Associated data length be part of header figure in [2.2.1.4.1. ](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-dekater-scion-controlplane-08.html#section-2.2.1.4.1)[AS Entry Signed Header](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-dekater-scion-controlplane-08.html#name-as-entry-signed-header)?  --> Already fixed in v-09\n- [x] Which formula is correct for signature calculation? Does the [formula in the text](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-dekater-scion-controlplane-08.html#section-2.2.1.4.3-5) correspond to what the code actually does in terms of signature calculation ([here? ](https://github.com/scionproto/scion/blob/771c63e390f81bcaf7c10c828f40e191c49af1af/pkg/segment/seg.go#L327))? Right now we have this formula where the AS own entry _ASE_i^(signed)_ is at the end  : \n```\n   Sig_i = K_i( SegInfo || ASE_0^(signed) || Sig_0 || ... || ASE_(i-1)^(signed) || Sig_(i-1) || ASE_i^(signed) )\n```\nThen we have  this text, that I think does not match the order in the previous formula : \n```\ninput(ps, i) = signed.header_and_body || associated_data(ps, i)\n```\nI think it one of the two should change: \n```\n  input(ps, i) =  associated_data(ps, i) || signed.header_and_body\nor \n  Sig_i = K_i( ASE_i^(signed) || SegInfo || ASE_0^(signed) || Sig_0 || ... || ASE_(i-1)^(signed) || Sig_(i-1) )\n```\n([Slack discussion](https://scionproto.slack.com/archives/C07EDUQSE6L/p1760258044184369))\n- [x] `header_and_body` is explained, but its content is not specified in protobuf. We only define `HeaderAndBodyInternal` in the appendix. Should we change `HeaderAndBodyInternal`  to `HeaderAndBody` ?\n- [ ] `message ASEntry` in protobuf is defined twice, once in [2.2.1.3. AS Entry](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-dekater-scion-controlplane-08.html#section-2.2.1.3)[AS Entry](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-dekater-scion-controlplane-08.html#name-as-entry) and once in [Figure 20](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-dekater-scion-controlplane-08.html#name-control-service-grpc-api-si) in the appendix. --> To be handled in #67 ",

      "body": "This document is the one most directly answering questions posed in RFC 9217, so I look forward to future pre-standardization work on the control plane to be discussed in PANRG.\n\n## Technical Issues\n\n- Section 2.3.4: I'm interested in the derivation of the parameters given here, in that there are a few system parameters that emerge from them that in turn dictate the performance and operational characteristics of a SCION internet. Were these derived from simulation, or from experience with the existing (much smaller than the big-I Internet) Anapaya and SCIONlab networks?\n\n- Have the PCB set sizes been tested against realisitic reference interdomain topologies? The intra-AS (editorial: shouldn't this be inter-AS, since it's leafward?) PCB size seems reasonable in a transit-customer-heavy topology (like the relationships that IIUC SCION was originally designed for), but in a realistic peering-heavy topology with fairly decentralized peering points (cf. the internet in Europe), I could see the peering links dominate PCBs such that viable peering shortcuts would be lost at the leaves with only 50 available per PCB. 3.3.2 points to a small diameter assumption following Barabasi... but I'm not sure the dynamics driving that model are the same that lead to Internet interdomain connectivity.\n\n- The core beacon size similarly seems to have a core AS model in mind (that of a small coterie of completely connected providers, analogous to \"Tier 1\" in the 20th century Internet topology) that may not apply in every ISD.\n\n- Similarly, propagation delay is related to the availability risk of a link outage. The 60 second core beaconing interval implies that the maximum time that a disconnect event (i.e., links between one core AS and the others, or an inter-ISD link, being commpletely down) would lead to packet loss is 60 seconds; this is long enough that it would probably trigger application and transport layer session resets in the absence of widespread peering shortcuts (which the PCB size seems to limit, see above)\n\n_KM - the above would all seem to be philosophical questions._ \n\n- [x] Section 7, general question: are there any rules for converting an ICMP message to SCMP, or vice versa? The protocol seems designed to support this, so I was missing a mention of it in this section.\n\n## Editorial Issues\n\n- [x] I found at least one missing Oxford comma with a clarity impact (Section 1 para 2 \"and provide continuity\".)\n_KM - there are inconsistencies between US and British stylisation in various places (not all introduced by me!). I'm a proponent of the Oxford comma (Adrian may not be), but also 'e.g.' (British style) compared to 'e.g.,' (US style). For me, 'e.g.' uses less characters and looks cleaner, although I don't know what the RFC Editor style guide says about it._ \n\n- [x] Section 1.4.1: what about path segments between non-core ASs? I understand that coreward segments are up and leafward down, but that's not what this list says. --> we can say \"There are no segments starting and ending at non-core ASes. IN these situations, several segments are combined during path lookup (REF to 5.1.  Lookup Process)\" \n\n\n- [x] Section 1.5.3: is there any interoperability concern with respect to non-wire representations of ISD/AS numbers? I'm confused about the 2119 language here. Some explanatory text in the frontmatter of 1.5.3 about why we care about text representation would be useful.\n\n- [x] Section 2.2.1: Figure 6, the top-down composition of a PCB, would be easier to read if it were broken up and interspersed through the text as a series of smaller, more focused diagrams.\n\n- [x] Section 2.2.2.1 (and maybe elsewhere): \"MUST consists\".",

If you're using NTP and NTP is attacked, what are the implications?  Same with GPS.

This issue might also affect -controlplane.\n\n[Slack discussion](https://scionproto.slack.com/archives/C8ADA9CEP/p1762452155817339)\n\nRelates to past issues: \n- #18\n- #117 \n\n ",

Specifically, expensive recursive path segment and trust material lookups are thus shielded from abuse by unauthorized entities.\r\nFor RPC methods exposed to other ASes, the control service implementation minimizes its attack surface by rejecting illegitimate callers based on ISD/AS, path type and length and any other available data points as soon as possible, i.e. immediately after determining the request type. For example:\r\n- `SegmentCreationService.Beacon` can only be called by direct neighbors and thus calls from peers with a path length greater than one can immediately be discarded. \r\n- `SegmentRegistrationService.SegmentsRegistration` can only be called from within the same ISD, thus the source address must match the local ISD and the number of path segments must be 1.\r\n",

The messages and remote procedure calls described below are in \"proto3\" language. For more information on Protobuf, see the official [\"Protocol Buffers Documentation\"](https://protobuf.dev/).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis looks a bit out of place where it currently is and I think it's redundant with the information in the \"## Communication protocol\" section. I'd suggest to remove it (or integrate anything that could still be relevant into the Communication Protocol section).",

This is used for all path discovery.\r\n  - path segment registration uses the path being registered.\r\n  - path lookup is incremental (not sure if this is already described somewhere else); use any known up-segment to lookup core segments to destination ISD. Then use any up-core paths to lookup down segments in destination ISD.\r\n    For this type of requests, typically many paths will be available to choose from. Basic implementation can pick random path and simply retry on faults. Better would be to keep track of path properties like experienced latency, loss rate, etc and pick \r\n  - None of these are binding, CS can arbitrarily pick any available path.\r\n- Service address resultion: even though I'd like this to go away, I'm not optimistic about finding a consensus for an alternative approach for this and implementing it quickly. I think we should include how this currently works:\r\n  - document the message types from `svc_resolution.proto`.\r\n  - the service resolution protocol:\r\n     - send service resolution request ; single UDP pkt with `ServiceResolutionRequest{}`  destination port 0, dst host SVC_CS. Note request is an empty protobuf message, so this is an empty datagram.\r\n     - whoever is SVC_CS in destination AS (resolved by ingress router, see service addresses in dataplane draft) sends single UDP pkt reply to source ISD-AS,address:port of the request with `ServiceResolutionResponse{}` body, that contains a host addresses + UDP port for the transport type \"QUIC\".\r\n  - initiate QUIC connection to address in `response.transports[\"QUIC\"]`.\r\n- TLS certificates for QUIC: for all the RPCs described here, self signed dummy certificates can be used, as we do _not_ check the server (or client) certificates; the messages transported over the RPCs are individually authenticated and we do not need a secure channel.\r\n  - Side note: in practice, we use CP-PKI AS certificates, just because we can, and because we use it to establish a secure channel for experimental extensions that _do_ benefit from a secure channel (i.e. for DRKey, but perhaps we shouldn't mention this).",

How about we put it in  section `Reception of PCBs`? or after `Path-Segment Registration on Code-Level`? \r\n\r\nAlso, I'd  separate text for each one of the drafts. Here, I'd mention only text that is specific to the control plane, and I'd put it somewhere else. \r\n\r\n> Routers along a packet's path verify the validity of hop fields by comparing the current time with a hop's expiration time.\r\nThis expiration time is calculated as described in [](#hopfield) on the basis of the segment's timestamp. That timestamp is assigned by the host that originates the segment. A fast clock at origination or a slow clock at a router will yield a lengthened time-to-live; possibly an origination time in the future. A slow clock at origination or a fast clock at a router will yield a shortened time to live; possibly an expiration time in the past.\r\n> By default, segments are propagated once a minute. A segment is registered by the last AS of that segment, therefore up to N minutes after origination, where N is the length of the segment. As a result, a segment must have a life time of at least N minutes to be of any use. N being the length of the segment. On the other hand, a very recent segment, which clocks offset could make appear from the future, ages by 1 minute per hop before being used, thereby reducing the impact of clock drift in that respect.\r\n\r\nThis feels more like a discussion about propagation interval, it is something that is missing on the draft, but I don't think it strictly relates to clock drift.\r\nIn the CP it is not routers, but the control service who is validating  hop field validity in PCBs. I think this section is not about clock drift, more about how propagation interval and HF expiration time interplay. I think this paragraph could go where we say `- The *propagation interval* SHOULD be at least \"5\" (seconds) for intra-ISD beaconing and at least \"60\" (seconds) for core beaconing.`\r\n\r\n\r\n> The unit of a segment's time-to-live is 5 minutes and 37 seconds (and 500 ms), or the equivalent of 5 hops. Given the above constraints, it is unreasonable to create a segment with a short time-to-live, while each additional time-to-live unit adds more than 5 minutes. As a result, a clock drift of up to 1 minute can be safely neglected.\r\nThe control service and its clients authenticate each-other according to their respective AS's certificate. Path segments are authenticated based on the certificates of the ASes that they refer to. The time validity of a certificate is affected by the offset between verifier and originator clocks. The expiration of a SCION AS certificate typically ranges from 3h to 5 years. As a result, a time offset measured in minutes is immaterial.\r\nEach administrator of a SCION router or core control service is responsible for maintaining sufficient clock accuracy. No particular method is assumed by this specification.\r\n\r\nI'd reword this section to say that the maximum clock drift between any two ASes is in the range of the \r\nmin(`exp_time`) - sum(propagation intervals along a path) where min(`exp_time`) is 337.5s. \r\nIt would be also nice to say something more about propagation intervals in the section described above. Is there a maximum propagation interval somewhere? If not, shall we explain what are the tradeoffs and why we recommend min 5 and 60s (and why this value should not be too high)? ",

Given the philosophy of SCION, the goal should be to propagate PCBs with the highest probability of collectively meeting the needs of the end hosts that will perform path construction. Of course, this AS doesn't know that.

I couldn't find any description\r\n  of this interval, maybe I overlooked it? Is it the same as the propagation interval?\r\n\r\n\r\n# Some points I found could be useful to add to the doc:\r\n- I couldn't find a discussion of beacon origination interval (or the RegistrationInterval), see \"DefaultOriginationInterval\" (or the DefaultRegistrationInterval) in the code.\r\n  Maybe I overlooked it? \r\n- Load balancing? E.g. everybody picks the shortest paths, all other paths remain unused...? How is this handled?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\n## Avoiding Circular Dependencies and Partitioning\r\n- Does this section (title) make sense as it is? The two topics (circular dependencies and partitioning) appear unrelated. Partitioning is discussed in a separate subsection\r\n- Also, this section claims to contain a list that explains how circular dependencies are avoided.\r\n  However, I am not sure how anything in the list explains anything about circular dependencies?\r\n\r\n### Partition and Healing\r\n- `ASes could always switch to otherwise unused links`. \r\n\r\n  - What are `unused` links? `Unused` indicates that they are not in the \"Best PCB\" set. \r\n  If that is the case, then we cannot simply \"switch\" to use them, we first need to have them discovered by beacons. This takes time, see `propagation interval` (unless PCB are forwarded immediately) and beacon `origination interval`.\r\n  - Also: Does \"Healing\" include \"adding new links\"? In this case we also need to wait for the `propagation interval` and the `origination interval`.\r\n  As I understand, with propagation interval being set to e.g. 10Minutes, this adds up to 5hops*1/2*10min= 25minutes for 5 hops.\r\n\r\n# Path Exploration or Beaconing {#beaconing}\r\n## Introduction and Overview\r\n\r\n- `Intra-ISD beaconing`: Isn't this incomplete? How are DOWN segments created? I think leaf ASes need to propagate paths back to the COREs? -> Link to #intra-reg ?\r\n- `Inter-ISD beaconing`: Similarily, I think there is a step where CORE beacons share their path DB with other CORE ASes in the same ISD?\r\n\r\n### Extending a PCB\r\n- `selects the best combinations`: Maybe link to a section that explains how this works? And what \"best\" means?\r\n\r\n## Path-Segment Construction Beacons\r\n### PCB Validity\r\n- `For the purpose of validation, a timestamp is considered \"future\" if it is later than the current time at the point of validation plus the minimum expiration time of a hop field (337.5 seconds, see ).`\r\nMaybe add an explanation why we add the minimum expiration time here?\r\nShouldn't \"future\" simply be timestamp + some_delta_to_account_for_server_time_inaccuracies, where the delta is maybe a few seconds rather than 5.5 minutes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Propagation of PCBs {#path-prop}\r\n### Selection of PCBs to Propagate {#selection}\r\n#### Storing and Selecting Candidate PCBs\r\n\r\n- `temporary storage`: Maybe clarify what \"temporary\" means. \r\n  - How long are PCBs stored? \r\n  - Under what circumstances are they removed, e.g. when they expire? \r\n  - Or possibly replaced with a new version? What if the new version has an earlier expiration date?\r\n\r\n\r\n- `At each propagation event, each AS selects a set of the best PCBs from the candidates in the beacon store`\r\n\r\n\r\n- `The best PCBs set size SHOULD be at most \"50\" (PCBs) for intra-ISD beaconing and at most \"5\" (PCBs) for core beaconing.`\r\n  - I found this a bit confusing: the \"50\" appears to be the total number of beacons forwarded for non-core ASes, whereas the \"5\" refers to the number of \r\n    PCBs _per_ remote CORE AS. Maybe clarify this?\r\n\r\n- `Note that during bootstrapping and if the AS obtains a PCB containing a previously unknown path, the AS SHOULD forward the PCB immediately, [...].`\r\n  - Is this true? It appears to conflict with many other parts of the document that talk about propagation intervals in the contect of cold-start.\r\n  - Is there a difference between \"bootstrapping\" (used here) and \"cold-start\" (used in other places)? Maybe stick to one term or explicitly declare equality?\r\n  - Is this subject to the \"Best 5 PCB\" rule? -> If a new path is immediately forwarded, does it count towards th \"best 5\"? If not, then we are effectively\r\n    forwarding >5 paths, correct? If yes, then the first 5 paths are always the best until they expire and can be replaced with other paths? \r\n  - What means \"unknown path\"? Does it refer to all links in the segment or just the remote AS? If it is all links in the segment, then there may be many new paths\r\n    coming in all the time that need to be forwarded immediately, or not?\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n### Effects of Clock Inaccuracy\r\n- `PCBs are propagated at a configurable interval (typically, one minute).`\r\n  - Unless they are new, then the interval is ignored, see \"immediate cold-start PCB forwarding\".\r\n  - Maybe rephrase: \"(typically, one minute)\" ---> \"immediately for new beacons, minimum 5secs for intra-ISD, minimum one minute for inter-ISD\"?\r\n  See #path-prop: \"The propagation interval SHOULD be at least \"5\" (seconds) for intra-ISD beaconing and at least \"60\" (seconds) for core beaconing.\".\r\n  - Also, AFAIK, the current configured real-world interval is more like 10-15 minutes...?  \r\n\r\n- `PCBs with N hops may be validated up to N intervals (so typically N minutes) after origination`\r\n  - I think the word \"typically\" is misleading here, it can be understood as \"PCBs [...] are validated typically after N minutes\", whereas it actually means that the _maximum_ is typically N minutes. \r\n    Rephrase to \"(maximally N minutes)\" or \"(amounting to N minutes, assuming the minimum inter-ISD propagation interval)\"\r\n\r\n- Rephrase `The norm is 6 hours.` to `... SHOULD be 6 hours` ? What does 'norm' mean?\r\n\r\n- `In comparison to these time scales, clock offsets in the order of minutes are immaterial.`  \r\n  - This relates only to the previous paragraph about certificates; I guess it should be attached to the previous paragraph?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Path Discovery Time and Scalability {#scalability}\r\n- ~`balances _OF_ the number of discovered paths` -> remove OF~ Already fixed\r\n\r\n- `Generally, the time until a specific PCB is built depends on its length and the propagation interval.`? \r\n   - I think in the context of \"cold boot\u00a8, the propagation delay is \"0\", see \"immediate cold-start PCB forwarding\".\r\n- `PCB arrives at a random point in time during the interval and is buffered before potentially being propagated`\r\n  - see \"immediate cold-start PCB forwarding\"\r\n  - Also, I think the calculation needs to take into account the \"beacon origination interval\".\r\n\r\n- `As will become apparent, the inter-ISD beaconing results in excessive overhead with very large numbers of participating core ASes.`\r\n  - Does this need to be in the IETF spec?\r\n- `The ideal topology for SCION is to keep the inter-ISD core network to a moderate size, to benefit from the divide-and-conquer partitioning of ASes into ISDs and the efficiency of the intra-ISD beaconing.`\r\n  - What is done to ensure this? What happens if the size is not moderate? What is \"moderate\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Intra-ISD Beaconing\r\n\r\n- `Otherwise, child ASes at distance D below the new link, learn of the new link after D further propagation steps`\r\n   - New path: \"immediate cold-start PCB forwarding\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Inter-ISD Beaconing\r\n\r\n- `On a cold start of the network, [...]. With a 5 second propagation period [...]`\r\n   - Above it says that bootstrapping results in immediatede forwarding, see \"immediate cold-start PCB forwarding\".\r\n\r\n- `When a new link is added to the network, it will be available to connect two ASes at distances from the link D1 and D2 from the link, respectively, after a mean time (D1+D2)*T/2.`\r\n  - Typo: duplicated \"from the link\";\r\n  - Also: see previous point about \"immediate cold-start PCB forwarding\"\r\n",

SHOULD be 6 hours` ? What does 'norm' mean? \r\n\r\nI am a bit reluctant to use RFC2119 language (uppercase SHOULD) for exactly 6 hours. This is a value that overall depends on the maximum AS path expected in the network, and it might as well be a different value. I therefore rephrased like this:\r\n`For this reason, it is unadvisable to create hops with a short expiration time, that should be around 6 hours.` \r\n\r\n> In comparison to these time scales, clock offsets in the order of minutes are immaterial.\r\n> This relates only to the previous paragraph about certificates; I guess it should be attached to the previous paragraph?\r\n\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Regarding Path Discovery Time and Scalability {#scalability} \r\n\r\n> The notes contain several references to \"immediate cold-start PCB forwarding\"  \r\n\r\n@matzf clarified [here](https://github.com/scionassociation/scion-cp_I-D/pull/42#discussion_r1666689901) that this is not the case, I removed that note, this should also solve some many of the consistency issues you reported.\r\n\r\n> Also, I think the calculation needs to take into account the \"beacon origination interval\".\r\n \r\n To be handled in https://github.com/scionassociation/scion-cp_I-D/issues/45\r\n \r\n\r\n> `As will become apparent, the inter-ISD beaconing results in excessive overhead with very large numbers of participating core ASes.` \r\nDoes this need to be in the IETF spec?\r\n\r\nGood point, I rephrased this section to: \r\n```To achieve scalability in its routing process, SCION uses a divide-and-conquer approach, partitioning  ASes into ISDs. In order to benefit from this, an ideal topology SCION should keep the inter-ISD core network to a moderate size. For more specific observations, we distinguish between intra- and inter-ISD beaconing. ```\r\n\r\n> What is done to ensure this? What happens if the size is not moderate? What is \"moderate\"?\r\n \r\n We give some numbers in the  Inter-ISD Beaconing section with an example with 1000 core ASes, this gives a rough figure. The bandwidth and computation overhead figures there should also give a rough hint of what happens if the network grows too much: the overhead becomes considerable. \r\n What is done to ensure this IMHO depends on how the network is deployed, I think this topic would be a better fit to be discussed in the new deployment Internet Draft, I opened an issue there: https://github.com/scionassociation/scion-deployment_I-D/issues/1  \r\n \r\n > Typo: duplicated \"from the link\";\r\n\r\nFixed\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n",

Due to the variable length fields in AS entries, the sizes for storage and transmission cannot be predicted exactly, and we'll assume an average of 250 bytes per AS entry. At the shortest, and thus chattiest, recommended propagation interval of 5 seconds, this corresponds to an average bandwidth of around 2.5MB/s, and processing 10000 signature verifications per second.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, I assume PCBs would be sent in batches (50000*250 would be ~ 12MB of PCBs), right?

From that naive perspective, I fail to grasp how recipients or senders requiring a proof of transit would help detect the wormhole. After all, the two attacker ASes are colluding to rewrite the packets. It seems to me they ought to have everything they need to write the fake proof of transit as well; the peering link could be real. In fact, there is no need to rewrite the packets; they could be tunneled into honest scion traffic taking the long route between the two attackers, making the peering link basically real. But that's probably just me not understanding how the proof is constructed.\r\n\r\nI am also not quite sure that the scenario qualifies as a wormhole attack. The usual scenario is that traffic is actually taken on shorter route without permission. So, the attacker is already on the path; the goal being to deceive the sender and receiver about their proximity (and, among other things, the perenity of the connectivity). In that case, proof of transit could defend against the attack. However, that isn't the case in your example. Your example is more of a reverse wormhole attack: an attractive wormhole is advertised but does not exist. The traffic takes a long route. So the purpose of the attacker is to insert itself on the path.\r\n",

I'm not entirely fond of the current text, perhaps it could be shortened.. something like: \r\n\r\n> This document describes the Control Plane of the path-aware, inter-domain network architecture SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-generation networks). One of the basic characteristics of SCION is that it gives path control to SCION-capable endpoints that can choose between multiple path options, enabling the optimization of network paths. \r\nThe Control Plane is responsible for securely discovering these paths and making them available to the endpoints. This document elucidates the mechanisms of path exploration through beaconing, path registration, and lookup, and introduces SCION's routing concepts, providing a comprehensive understanding of the control plane's role in establishing and managing path segments, that are used by the data plane for forwarding.\r\n\r\n",

Yes, they may be multiple rounds, but at some point the segments expire. Once segments expire, they should forward them again (assuming they are superior to other segments which may have not been forwarded yet). With an expiration time of, say, 1 hour and forwarding every 60 seconds, we get a maximum of 60*5 = 300 segments. If we have more than 300 segments, then we will never forward all of them. \r\n\r\nIf we permitted forwarding _all_ segments, that may overload the network (the number of paths growths exponentially). So we cannot physically forward all segments because that would be an attack in itself.\r\n\r\nIf \"permit\" is more liberal here then previously specified, maybe rephrase to \"where all traversed ASes permit _unlimited_ forwarding\"?\r\nOtherwise I think a reader would interpreted \"permit\" as specified in the section \"Selection of PCBs to Propagate\".\r\nAgain, similar to the point I made earlier, I am not sure why we list assumptions here that, as I understand, do not apply to the specified system. It may help to have an more explicit statement that explains that some assumptions do not apply and why we list them anyway...?\r\nI feel I am missing something important here.\r\n\r\n> I updated wording to follow the terminology in the draft (\"path segment\", \"forwarding path\").

If the assumptions do not match the actual specified system, why are we discussing them in the RFC?\r\n\r\n Because, based on the review we received by the formal methods group, they clearly recommend clarify assumptions and security properties, I forwarded you what we received. \r\n \r\n How about we reword the assumptions section in general?  We now have: \r\n ```\r\nThe following assumptions relate to these security considerations. It is assumed that:\r\n\r\n1. Every ISD contains at least one core AS.\r\n2. ISDs are not internally partitioned, so that each AS can reach every other AS within its ISD.\r\n3. Parent-Child links form a unidirectional hierarchical topology without cyclic relationships.\r\n4. An AS is described as 'honest' if its private keys are unknown to the attacker and it uses a unique interface identifier for each link. An honest path is one that only traverses honest ASes. A honest segment is the one created by an honest AS.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think for these assumptions: \r\n\r\n1. We don't need it as we already say in the draft that an ISD MUST contain a core AS. \r\n2. We could reword it, saying that for the security properties to hold, an ISD SHOULD not be internally partitioned. \r\n3. I don't think we need this one. The beaconing algorithm stops re-propagating beacons if there is a loop, handling this and making the topology acyclic. Therefore, every AS then finds its way to the core through the acyclic graph.  I tried hard to think of an example where a loop would isolate an AS, and I couldn\u2019t. (Unless I\u2019m missing something)\r\n4. THis is not really an assumption, rather a definition of how we sue \"honest\"\r\n\r\nBased on my thought above, we could rewrite the assumption paragraph like this: \r\n\r\n> For the following security properties to hold, ISDs should not be internally partitioned, so that each AS can reach every other AS within its ISD. In addition,  an AS is described as 'honest' if its private keys are unknown to the attacker and if it uses a unique interface identifier for each link. An honest path is one that only traverses honest ASes. A honest segment is the one created by an honest AS.\r\n\r\n@tzaeschke What do you think?

If it is core, it may reach other ASes while transiting via other ISDs if permitted by its policies. In such case, transiting via another ISD may potentially allow external agents to influence the internal connectivity of an ISD.** \r\n\r\nThis was a quick and dirty wording, I'd need to think a bit more about it\r\n",

The Control Service registers the newly created down segments with the Control Services of the core ASes that originated the corresponding PCBs. This is done by invoking the `SegmentRegistrationService.SegmentsRegistration` remote procedure call (RPC) in the Control Services of the relevant core ASes (see also [](#reg-proto)).

Implementations MAY accept AS numbers in the lower 32-bit range in hexadecimal notation too, but they should convert them to decimal notation (e.g., a program may accept AS number '0:1:f' and convert it to 65551).\r\n- SCION AS numbers in the higher 32-bit range MUST be represented using big-endian hexadecimal notation in 3 groups of 4, in the range `1:0:0` to `ffff:ffff:ffff`. Leading zeros in each group are omitted, with the exception that one zero MUST be notated if a group is entirely zeros (e.g., `1:0:1`). The `::` zero-compression feature of IPv6 MUST NOT be used.\r\n- A range of AS numbers can be shortened with a notation similar to the one used for CIDR IP ranges ({{RFC4632}}). In such case, hexadecimal notation MUST be used. For example, the range of the lowest 32-bit AS numbers (0-4294967295) can be represented as `0:0:0/16`.\r\n```",

Internally neither string representations are used. Any conversion that takes place is from string to internal (when parsing config or args from humans) and from internal to string (when printing out human readable information or generating config). So, conversions between the two string representations aren't relevant. We must state what is printed and what is parsed. That's it.\r\n",

How about: \r\n```suggestion\r\nSuch information is then made available to source endpoints during the path lookup process (See [](#lookup)). Note that the destination endpoint does not receive such information, therefore when using path reversibility, it should use mechanisms to estimate the reverse path MTU (e.g., MTU discovery or estimate MTU from the largest packet received). SCION endpoints are oblivious to the internal topology of intermediate ASes. When looking up a path they should therefore assume that all hops are also constrained by the intra-AS MTU of each AS traversed.\r\n```\r\n",

Can you think of something better? \r\n\r\n\r\n> I think the \"detachable extension\" is not implemented, or is it?\r\n\r\nI see there is  a detatchable extension defined for EPIC [here](https://github.com/scionproto/scion/blob/38e79c43faf38ebec719ac71fb65e1f814050e3b/proto/control_plane/v1/seg_extensions.proto#L170),  unless I'm mistaken \r\n\r\n>  how do we know whether it is a signed hash or a signed extension? From the length? I guess I'm missing something?\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that you need the same protobuf definition on both sides, then it is protobuf that magically gives you the same object. I think this is also how it is implemented for EPIC.\r\n\r\n> I think a clean solution would be to always only sign the hash.\r\n\r\nI agree, but we won't redesign the protocol in this document. This is why we have the section recommending the detachable approach for large amount of data. \r\n ",
